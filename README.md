# Learning-Java

The reason I decided to try and learn java first is because it seems fairly basic and widely used. The dream is to become fluent enough in java that I can carry my skills over into the android app development world. I found a special knack for html programming in a university class I took as well; xml (the other language that android apps use) is very similar. So, this seems like it might work to my advantage.
